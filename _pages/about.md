I'm a Neuroscience PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh ([CNUP](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/about) & [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/)) working with [Bea Luna](https://lncd.pitt.edu/wp/) and [Cecile Ladouceur](https://www.candlab.pitt.edu/). Before Pitt, I worked as a post-bac Research Coordinator for two years with [Ian Gotlib](https://mood.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I completed my BA in Neuroscience and Philosophy at Bates College, ME.

I use neuroimaging techniques (e.g., sMRI, rsfMRI, MRS) to study the neurobiological mechanisms driving developmental processes. My goal is to characterize the neurobiology of cognitive control and emotion regulation as they mature across adolescence typically and transdiagnostically across psychiatric disorders.
