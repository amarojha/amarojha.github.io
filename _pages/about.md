Hello! I'm a neuroscientist working with [Arielle Keller](https://appliedcognitionlab.psychology.uconn.edu/) at the University of Connecticut as a Postdoctoral Research Associate to understand how the multivariate effects of early life environments shape the experience-dependent neurodevelopment of brain circuits that support affective and cognitive control. I am particularly interested in characterizing neurobiological mechanisms of plasticity that may confer risk for neuropsychiatric disorders during critical periods of development but also inform person-specific and anatomically precise therapeutic targets for interventions administered in a developmentally sensitive manner. My work seeks to integrate theoretical and methodological approaches from human neuroimaging, developmental psychology, evolutionary neurobiology, statistics, and psychiatric and behavioral sciences. 

I completed my graduate training from the University of Pittsburgh ([CNUP](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/about) & [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/)) working with [Bea Luna](https://lncd.pitt.edu/wp/) and [Cecile Ladouceur](https://www.candlab.pitt.edu/), where I studied the neurodevelopment of affective and cognitive control processes, typically and transdiagnostically. 

Before Pitt, I worked as an MRI Research Coordinator with [Ian Gotlib](https://mood.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University investigating the effects of early life stress on affective neurodevelopment. Prior to that, I completed my B.A. in Neuroscience and Philosophy from Bates College.
