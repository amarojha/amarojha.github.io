I'm a Neuroscience PhD candidate at the University of Pittsburgh ([CNUP](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/about) & [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/)) working with [Bea Luna](https://lncd.pitt.edu/wp/) and [Cecile Ladouceur](https://www.candlab.pitt.edu/) to study cognitive and affective development. Before Pitt, I worked as a Research Coordinator for two years with [Ian Gotlib](https://mood.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University investigating the effects of early life stress on neurodevelopment and mood disorders using (f)MRI. I completed my BA in Neuroscience and Philosophy at Bates College.

Currently, I use neuroimaging techniques (e.g., sMRI, rsfMRI, MRS) to study the mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopment of cognitive control, emotion regulation, and motivated behaviors, primarily in adolescents, both typically and transdiagnostically. 

My larger career goal is to leverage multimodal datasets and computational approaches to better understand the neural substrate underlying mental landscapes as they unfold across development.
