Hello!

I'm a Neuroscience PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh ([CNUP](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/about) & [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/)) working with [Bea Luna](https://lncd.pitt.edu/wp/) and [Cecile Ladouceur](https://www.candlab.pitt.edu/) to study cognitive and affective development. Before Pitt, I worked as a post-bac Research Coordinator for two years with [Ian Gotlib](https://mood.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University investing the effects of early life stress on neurodevelopment and mood disorders. I completed my BA in Neuroscience and Philosophy at Bates College.

Currently, I use neuroimaging techniques (e.g., sMRI, rsfMRI, MRS) to study the mechanisms underlying the neurodevelopment of cognitive control, emotion regulation, and motivated behaviors, primarily in adolescents, both typically and transdiagnostically. 

My larger career goal is to leverage multimodal datastes and computational approaches to sharpen our understanding of mental landscapes as they unfold across development and in the context of biological psychiatry.

Feel free to reach out to me with questions at amo80 [at] pitt [dot] edu
